# KeyToAscii 
This is a very simple c program that translates keypresses on your keyboard to their ascii values and any other dictionaries loaded.

Upon pressing esc the program will close. (If you happen to be wondering what ascii value esc is it's 27)

!! This has been tested for windows, it may or may not work on linux or macOS (most likely won't) !!
